          "desc": "###**Mickey and the Magician** is a live stage show that premiered in \"Animagique Theater\" at Walt Disney Studios Park since July 2, 2016.\n\nTo illustrate this return to where the magic all began, the creators draw inspiration from the great illusionist Georges Méliès and the famous magician Robert-Houdin. This is not a traditional magic show. The illusions will form the basis of this brand new story. Disneyland Paris has called on the acclaimed magician Paul Kieve to create these illusions. Paul Kieve said that it’s hard to think of the word ‘Disney’ without also thinking of the word ‘Magic’. He became fascinated with magic when he was 10 years old and was always inventing ideas in his head. One of the great things about working on ‘Mickey and the Magician' is that I can bring some of these ideas into reality.\n\n###**Show summary**\nThis 28-minute musical show is set in a great Magician’s atelier in 19th century of Paris, where the assistant is no other than a certain [Mickey](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Mickey) (with an [articulated head](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Disney_Characters%27_Articulated_Heads)) is given the task of cleaning up the room at night, [Tinker Bell](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Tinker_Bell) has spread a little stardust. When he is given the task of cleaning up the atelier before sunrise, the young apprentice gets distracted! Nothing turns out as expected.\n\nMickey finds himself accidentally transported to the most magical worlds, featuring [Cinderella](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Cinderella_(1950_film)) ([Fairy Godmother](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Fairy_Godmother), Cinderella), [Beauty and the Beast](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast) ([Lumiere](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Lumiere), [Belle](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Belle), [Beast](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Beast)), [The Lion King](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lion_King) ([Rafiki](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Rafiki)), [Aladdin](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Aladdin_(film)) ([Genie](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Genie)), and [Frozen](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen) ([Elsa](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Elsa), [Olaf](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Olaf)).\n\nFinally, Mickey becomes the hero in this incredible show where illusion is key and the audience find themselves plunged into a world of magic and delight.",
