          "desc": "##**Review of the [W-Amsterdam](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/amswh-w-amsterdam/) (Netherlands)**\n\nJust steps away from the vibrant Dam Square and the Royal Palace, the W-Amsterdam features 238 stylish guest rooms and suites spread across two historic buildings, an erstwhile telephone exchange building (from the 1920s) and a 1906 former bank with a quiet road in between. Guests arrive in style when they check in at the rooftop W Lounge, the W brand’s re-interpretation of the traditional hotel lobby, on the sixth floor of the Exchange building. Looking out to the Royal Palace and lively historic centre, the 22 meter (72 ft) Wet Deck is Amsterdam’s first rooftop pool and is heated in winter. [(Source)](https://theluxurytravelexpert.com/2016/03/16/review-w-amsterdam/)\n\nW Amsterdam features in my top 10 list of [Europe’s best hotel rooftops](https://theluxurytravelexpert.com/2016/05/30/top-10-europes-most-stunning-hotel-rooftops/) and in my list of the [40 hottest luxury hotel openings of 2015](http://theluxurytravelexpert.com/2015/12/18/travel-news-the-40-hottest-luxury-hotel-openings-of-2015/).\n\n<<youtube:vI9f0Mt96_0>>\n\n<<ul:The hotel enjoys a **central location** in the Dutch capital, probably the best one of all hotels in Amsterdam. It’s located behind the Royal Palace, a stone’s throw from Dam Square, and steps from the city’s iconic canal district with its vibrant restaurants, bars and nightlife scene. It’s quite amazing that the Marriott Hotel Group was able to secure this terrific spot in Amsterdam.\n||The hotel is located in two buildings, with a quiet street in between. The main wing is housed in a gorgeously refurbished, former **telephone Exchange building**, a historic property constructed in the Amsterdam School style of architecture. It opened last spring, and has 169 stylish guestrooms, including 10 suites and one Extreme Wow Suite (the W brand’s interpretation of the Presidential Suite). Within the Exchange building, you also find a spectacular rooftop (with swimming pool) and the excellent Mr. Porter restaurant, but more on that later.\n||The hotel’s second wing across the street is located in the **Bank building** and has an additional 66 contemporary guestrooms and suites, many overlooking the famous UNESCO-listed Singel canal, as well as a signature Away Spa, nightclub and destination bar. The Bank building also includes the W Amsterdam’s signature The Duchess restaurant and a ‘creative incubator’ concept space, providing a platform for local talent to showcase their fashion, art and design work and also featuring locally curated products.\n||The hotel’s Exchange wing – where I stayed during my visit – has **two trendy lobbies**: a low-key entrance lobby on the ground level, from where two elevators shuttle guests to the main lobby (where check-in is done) on the hotel’s 6th floor rooftop.\n||The **hotel’s spectacular rooftop floor** is the architectural and social highlight of the hotel.  It is a vast, glass-walled, rectangular-shaped space, wrapped around a courtyard and extending over the entire top of the Exchange building. It contains two check-in desks, a trendy lounge (with two open fires), two bars, several outdoor terraces, and Mr Porter Restaurant.\n||Although it is not the highest building in Amsterdam, the rooftop offers **terrific city views** nonetheless. One side of the hotel looks directly onto the Royal Palace while the other three sides offer a view over Amsterdam’s rooftops. Even if you are not staying at the hotel, you should visit the rooftop lounge to have a drink and enjoy the vibe and panoramic views. Drinks range from traditional to eclectic and everything in between, as do the clientele, making people-watching a spectator sport.\n||The rooftop terrace fronting the Royal Palace has a **visually stunning infinity pool**. Although this outdoor pool is very small (only 2 m or 6,5 ft), it runs almost the entire length of the cornice (22 m or 72 ft), so you can swim laps if you want to. In addition, the pool is heated, making a dip in winter possible.\n||W-Amsterdam boasts a minimalist style and **industrial chic design**, with lots of mellow grey shades, colorful artwork, bright spaces, heigh ceilings, and concrete floors. It brings a touch of New York’s trendy hotel scene to the Dutch capital.\n||The hotel features **238 guest rooms and suites**, each one of them mixing historical details with contemporary features. During my visit I stayed in a so-called Wonderful Room, across the street from the Royal Palace. While not very large, it did feel spacious nonetheless because of the high ceiling and glass outside-wall. The room was very well appointed and the technology and audio was outstanding. It featured a super-comfy kingsized bed, an open-plan bathroom with a peek-a-boo shower, as well as a restroom and closet hidden behind a glassed door. After I checked in the room, the staff delivered a lovely and sexy plate with welcome snacks.\n||The hotel features **two excellent and highly recommended dining venues**. Mr Porter restaurant is located on the rooftop floor of the Exchange building and artfully blends a modern steakhouse’s prestige with the buzz of a chic lounge. Mr Porter’s entrance is marked by a walkway that leads past a glass display of dry aged meat. The hotel’s other restaurant, The Duchess, is located in a sumptuously decorated space (with a stained-glass ceiling) in the Bank building. It has more the feel of a French brasserie and its menu comprises exquisite Mediterranean produce combined with light and refined flavors from Southern France and Italy.\n||The **delicious breakfast** is served at mr Porter Restaurant and it is a hot contender for the very best and most original breakfast in town. Not only does it have the customary continental buffet, but it also features plenty of never-heard-of juices (e.g. cucumber & spinach, celery & apple) and very original salads (e.g. green beens, pomegranate, and blue cheese). In addition, you can also order one hot dish per person (e.g. pancakes or eggs benedict).\n||W Hotels definitely target a young, tech-savvy, modern market, and it is not different in this hotel: there is a trendy ambience, young staff, and music everywhere. Whenever, whatever. The hotel has definitely a **WOW factor** and it’s one of my two favorite W hotels around the world, the other one being the W-Barcelona (and I have visited many of them around the globe).\n>",

MR PORTER is a modern steakhouse by day which glides seamlessly into drinking hotspot by night, what a seductive match! TLE was asked along to experience the restaurant in our latest trip to Amsterdam and boy did we love it!\n\n###**Background & Concept**\nManaged by one of Amsterdam’s most successful creative hospitality entrepreneurs, Yossi Eliyahoo, whose Entourage Group also includes Momo, Izakaya and the W hotel’s grand ground floor establishment, The Duchess. The MR PORTER concept is simple and effective, it mixes the modern steakhouse with the buzz and experience of a New York style club-lounge. So fine dining sits comfortably hand in hand with some of the coolest DJs and mixologists in the city, so you can make a night of it, or whole afternoon of it as we did!\n\nThe experience starts on the ground floor of the W Hotel, this building was a former telephone exchange built in 1904, there are nods to the buildings past all through the building it has a very industrial feel to it.\n\n<<youtube:5Bq4iDs_iZw>>\n\n<<img:||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9321.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9428.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9324.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9370.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9331.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9435.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9441.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9438.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n||https://i0.wp.com/theluxuryeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_9448.jpg?w=1000&ssl=1\n>>\n\n<script>console.log('test')</script>",
